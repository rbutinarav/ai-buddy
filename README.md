# AI Buddy

Welcome to AI Buddy, a chatbot built with OpenAI, Python, and Streamlit. AI Buddy can interact with you using different personas, including historical figures like Leonardo Da Vinci, Albert Einstein, and Nelson Mandela. The chatbot is also able to remember past conversations and speak with its own voice. 

## Features

- Different personas can be selected to change the chatbot's personality
- Conversations can be saved to a remote blob storage
- Answers can be directly converted to speech
- Full conversational experience (speech-to-text and text-to-speech)

## On the way
