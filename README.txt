# This project shows how to implement a chatbot with Open AI, using Python and Streamlit for building the UI
# Different personas can be selected to change the chatbot's personality.
# Conversations can be saved to a remote blob storage

# Answers can be directly converted to speech using Azure Cognitive Services (experimental, currently only working locally for deployment issues)

# On the way:
# Full text to speech and speech to text integration
# Advanced context and personalization of personas for personalized experience
# Memory of previous Conversations
# Document search capabilities on local storage

# Future implementation:
# Web search (using langchain)
# Emaling / texting / social posting capabilities
# User authentication (for limited public release)
