# This project shows how to implement a chatbot with open AI, using streamlit and python.
# We use the open AI API the  to get the response from the chatbot.
# We use streamlit to create the web app.
# Different personas can be selected to change the chatbot's personality.

# REMEMBER to define in the streamlit app the OPENAI_KEY environment variable if you want to run it there.
# REMEMBER to create a .env file with your API key (OPENAI_KEY = "yourkey") and decomment in openai_fucntions.python
#    the two lines after #LOAD ENV VARIABLES if you want to run it locally
